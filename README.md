# Practical Machine Learning Course Project Submission

This repo contains my submission files. If you would like to compile the document and run the analysis on your local machine, download the zip file and follow along in 'submission.Rmd'. Otherwise, read 'submission.pdf', it contains a much prettier version of the document with graphs included. Github is not very good at reading html files.
